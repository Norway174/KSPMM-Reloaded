ModIO - Add support for streams and byte arrays, AND AN ACTUAL DISPLAY
Settings - Add support for icons for the nodes

ADDED BY NORWAY174:
I've added the Updater from KSPMM.
Haven't added the check for updates yet.

But to initialize the updater, simply just call these functions;

Dim UpdW As New Updater
UpdW.PassedText = UpdateUrl
UpdW.Show()

Replace "UpdateUrl" with the direct link to the new .exe.
This URL can be retrieved for the same way as it could for KSPMM.
I will add functions for that later, which you can then call whenever you think is needed. Such as each Start-up.
